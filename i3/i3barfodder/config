# CPU temperature
# These settings display a bar that starts to grow at 40° and maxes out at
# 50°.  It's updated every 10 seconds and displays the current temperature as
# a number if it is 45° or higher (DISPLAY_MIN).  Overriding the global

# CPU usage
# By default, i3bf-cpu displays a single vertical bar and a percentage to
# indicate overall CPU usage.  In this example, PERCORE is enabled to display
# one bar+percentage per core.  Because LAYOUT is used for each core, that
# would look cluttered and is therefore redefined to display a single block
# that displays only a vertical bar in a dynamic color with
# "separator_block_with" set to 2.

# and the current transfer rate as a number if it is larger than 10% of the

# vertical bar should reach half of its full height at 25% capacity.

# Storage I/O and usage

# takes precedence.  PERMALIST lists mountpoints that are displayed even if
